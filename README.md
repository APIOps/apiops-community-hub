#APIOps 

Just  like DevOps can be seen as offspring or spinoff of Agile thinking,  APIOps can be seen to extend DevOps to fulfil the needs of Application  Interface and Internet of Things development (IoT).  Therefore we, members of APIOps community foresee clear need for APIOps, a new breed of DevOps to support creation and maintence of IoT driven ecosystem. 

##Background
McKinsey Global Institute estimates the potential economic impact of the Internet of Things to be $2.7 trillion to $6.2 trillion per year by 2025.  The GSM Association predicts that by 2020, there will be 24 billion connected devices, while Cisco’s Internet of Everything prediction is 50 billion “intelligent things,” such as cars,  appliances, smartphones, tablets, monitoring sensors and more, connected  to the Internet. The rise of IoT depends on a whole host of enabling technologies like  RFID, IPv6, Big Data, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Web APIs, or more specifically REST APIs, are key for connecting devices to the Internet.

##IoT & APIs
A large part of the interoperability, scale, and control for IoT can be achieved through API management.  Standards-based design patterns for Web APIs, API management, and a  RESTful  architecture provide tremendous value in simplifying the task  of  interoperability across heterogeneous systems handling vast amounts  of  data. Since APIs have become ubiquitous, IoT deployments spanning a  wide  range of market segments can benefit from this proven  architecture.

**Companies focusing on enabling fast API development together with customers and nearby interest groups will rule the IoT.**
